# Neural Network Iris Flower Classifier

An interactive **Streamlit app** that classifies Iris flowers using a trained **TensorFlow Neural Network**. Users can adjust flower measurements with sliders and get real-time predictions.

This is my first attempt to implement my knowledge with Neurual Networks, and make a classic machine learning model. With the use of relu and softmax activation functions, and the use of Dense Neutron Layers, my model was able to acheive 96.67% accuracy. Due to limited complexity in this project, small dataset, and sparse features, working towards higher accuracy was a struggle. It was a fun project, my first ML project.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Input scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Live predictions with softmax output
- Streamlit-powered interactive UI
- Model saved in modern `.keras` format

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classifier.git
cd iris-classifier
```

### 2. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Users enter flower measurements using Streamlit sliders.

2. Inputs are scaled using a pre-trained StandardScaler (scaler.pkl).

3. A TensorFlow neural network (iris_nn_model.keras) predicts the flower class.

4. The predicted class is shown with a ðŸŒº emoji.
