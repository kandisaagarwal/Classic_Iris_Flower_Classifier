# Classic Iris Flower Classifier
This is my first attempt to implement my knowledge with Neurual Networks, and make a classic machine learning model. With the use of relu and softmax activation functions, and the use of Dense Neutron Layers, my model was able to acheive 96.67% accuracy. Due to limited complexity in this project, small dataset, and sparse features, working towards higher accuracy was a struggle. It was a fun project, my first ML project.

# How to run
In order to run this project, open the terminal and run:
  streamlit run app.py

# ðŸŒ¼ Neural Network Iris Flower Classifier

An interactive **Streamlit app** that classifies Iris flowers using a trained **TensorFlow Neural Network**. Users can adjust flower measurements with sliders and get real-time predictions.
